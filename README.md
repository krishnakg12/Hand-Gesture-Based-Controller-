# Hand-Gesture-Based-Controller-
# ✋ Hand Gesture-Based Virtual Controller

A real-time hand gesture recognition tool that allows users to control virtual actions using just hand movements. Built using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, the system enables touchless interaction by detecting and tracking hand landmarks through a webcam.


## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a lightweight, ML-based virtual controller that recognizes specific hand gestures in real time and maps them to actions like click, scroll, or zoom — useful in smart UI/UX design, accessibility, and AR/VR environments.


## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and real-time camera handling
- **MediaPipe** – Hand landmark detection and tracking
- **NumPy** – For spatial geometry calculations
- **PyAutoGUI (optional)** – To control the system UI with gestures
